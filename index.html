              At the beginning of the game, the player will draw 2 cards from
              the shuffled card deck and the dealer will draw 1 card. The player
              can see the 1 card that the dealer has drawn. The player can
              choose to hit to draw another card from the deck to get their
              score closer to 21, or stay to keep the score they have. It is
              then the turn of the dealer, who will continously pull cards from
              the deck so long as their score is 17 or under. Dealer will hit on
              S17 (soft 17) - (where an Ace counts as 11) and stand on H17 (hard
              17). Any score under 17, the dealer will draw a card.
